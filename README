The itlcmp is a simple command-line tool to compare the tracks in the iTunes
music library file with the media on disk. The source code is licensed using

This program was mainly intended as a mechanism to better understand the Go
language and toolset. The program's functionality also helps my need to
fastidiously maintain my media library. Twofer!
