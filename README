The itlcmp program is a simple command-line tool to compare the tracks in the iTunes
music library file with the media files on disk. The source code is licensed using
the Apache License, Version 2.0.

To build the program, execute the following:
$ go build

This program was mainly intended as a mechanism to better understand the Go
language and toolset. The program's functionality also helps my need to
fastidiously maintain my media library. Twofer!
